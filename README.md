# Epidemic Spread Simulation with Agent-Based Modeling

This mini-project involves creating an R Notebook to simulate the progression of an epidemic using an **Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) algorithm**. The simulation incorporates key elements such as:

- **Opinion Dynamics**: Capturing behavioral responses of agents.
- **Network Modeling**: Representing social interactions through networks (households, schools, workplaces, neighborhoods).
- **Game Theory**: Assessing strategic interactions among agents.

### Features
- Simulates disease progression with psychological and biological states.
- Models disease dynamics via a **transition matrix** considering factors like incubation, symptoms, immunity, and fatality.
- Visualizes interactions within a preferential attachment network influencing contagion probabilities.
- Tracks the epidemic's impact until the population reaches herd immunity.

This project provides an interactive and visual exploration of epidemic spread dynamics, enhancing understanding of complex systems. It was made as group work by Chesia Anyika, Joseph Romeo Waimiri, Brandon Erickson Mwangi and Daniel Nzambuli.
